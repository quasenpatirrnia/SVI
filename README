This is a work in progress.
If all goes well, this should evolve into a UNIX clone with slightly interesting features. I have some ideas of security management I want to try, which led me to begin the development of this program. As of some date in November 2024, it is just a hello world.

TODO:
Finish implementing EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE structure
Setup nicer ways to do the console IO, and get out of the boot services.
